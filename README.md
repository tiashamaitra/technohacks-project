# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes based on certain diagnostic measures included in the dataset. We have implemented several machine learning algorithms for this classification task, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors classifier, support vector classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, decision tree, and random forest.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains various health-related variables for Pima Indian women. The dataset can be found "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database"
## Algorithms Implemented

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
3. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
4. Gaussian Naive Bayes
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest

## Usage
